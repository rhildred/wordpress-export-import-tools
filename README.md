# Wordpress Tools

## tools to take student wordpress and import it into a customer's 

I think run:

1. `php -f dirwalker.php` to find all of the wp-config and export the posts and to find all of the wp-content folders and copy the images in to apr3combined/wp-content
2. `php -f addThumbnail.php` to process all of the xml files and add the featured images as a "regular" image link.
